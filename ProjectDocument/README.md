# 📊 StreamFlix Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

StreamFlix, an Italian-based film streaming platform, is transitioning from a free, ad-supported model to a **subscription-based service**. As part of this transformation, the company is looking to make data-informed decisions on which types of films to prioritise for acquisition and promotion.

Our team has been tasked with delivering **actionable insights** and **interactive visualisations** that will guide StreamFlix’s content strategy and user engagement model during this critical shift.
